# opposite-neurons

custom_plot.py is used in all the jupyter notebooks, so you will need to download it as well if you intend to run any of the jupyter notebooks.  
Running opposite_neurons_paper.ipynb will generate all the plots in the paper.  
Running opposite_neurons_paper.ipynb will generate all the plots in the SI of the paper.  
If you want to extend the project here, best place to start will be opposite_neurons.ipynb.  
opposite_neurons_2.ipynb is an extension of opposite_neurons.ipynb and is under construction.  
opposite_neurons_unedited.ipynb is a messy file intended for personal use.
